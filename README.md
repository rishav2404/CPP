## 📚 About

This repository is dedicated to learning, practicing, and mastering C++ (and some C) programming concepts. It serves as a personal playground for implementing algorithms, data structures, and exploring features of C++ through hands-on coding examples.

Whether you’re a beginner or revisiting C++ concepts, you’ll find a variety of educational code snippets, programs, and detailed explanations here.

## 📌 Features

- **Fundamental Concepts**: Variables, data types, control structures, functions, pointers, memory management.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Classes, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, abstraction.
- **Data Structures**: Arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs.
- **Algorithms**: Sorting, searching, recursion, dynamic programming.
- **STL (Standard Template Library)**: Vectors, maps, sets, iterators, algorithms.
- **C Basics**: Selected C programs to reinforce foundational concepts.
- **Practice Problems**: Solutions to classic programming problems and coding challenges.
